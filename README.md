# Sol-WAP

Sol-WAP is a rust application to calculate the Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) using Solana's Pyth oracle or Bonfida's API to fetch historical serum trades. 
## Pyth
Fetching historical data using Pyth will quickly hit the rate limits on most RPC servers. Future versions will implement a cache mechanism.
